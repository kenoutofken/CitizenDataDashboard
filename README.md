# CITIZEN DATA DASHBOARD - A03 - FUNCTIONAL CODE

By Ken Yau & Raizel Bacani

The purpose of this project is to redesign the health city dashboard for households spending more than 30% of income on housing. It aims to support current Vancouver residents, potential newcomers, policymakers, non-profit organizations, and housing advocates by making complex housing data easier to understand and compare across neighbourhoods. The project will help stakeholders make more informed decisions about housing affordability, community planning, and resource allocation.

Our main goal for this assignment is to create an interface for users to navigate this dataset in an intuitive and user friendly way. This project started with our team identifying issues with the layout and data visualization of the existing data dashboard. We took this analysis and build wireframes and prototypes to showcase our design solution. After receiving feedback on our prototype, we began the process of coding this project using React. Our tech stack for this project includes:

- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts
- Leaflet
- Daisy UI

The files contained within this project reflect our first iteration of the coded solution. Because this project is created in React, a few requirements and dependencies are needed in order to view the project on a local development server. Instructions on how to download these dependencies is detailed in the next section. Our project has also been uploaded online for testing and viewing at www.designedbyken.com/citizendatadashboard/.


## INSTRUCTIONS TO VIEW LOCALLY

As noted before, in order to view the included files locally, they need to be run on a local development server. Node.js is required as a prerequisite for this, which can be downloaded on their website at https://nodejs.org/en. Please restart your computer following the installation of Node.js to ensure it is probably integrated as a JavaScript runtime environment for your computer. Following this initial step, here are the steps to run our project locally:

1. Open the project folder on Visual Code Studio (or code editor of your choice)
2. Open the Command Palette or Terminal within your editor
3. Install dependencies by entering the command 'npm install' (this should use Node Package Manager to download all files required to run our project)
4. Start the server by entering the command 'npm run dev'
5. Open the server locally using the provided localhost link


### LIMITATIONS

The functional code does not reflect the complete design from the final prototype. The header and footer sections from the existing webpage of the Citizen Data Dashboard are not integrated in this version.
